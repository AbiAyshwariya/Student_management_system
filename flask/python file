Flask plays a crucial role in the "Student Management System" project as the web framework for backend development. It handles routing, request handling, and response generation, facilitating the creation of RESTful APIs for user authentication, CRUD operations, and data management. Flask's modular design allows for easy integration with ORM tools like SQLAlchemy for database interactions, ensuring efficient and scalable development of the application's backend functionalities.
